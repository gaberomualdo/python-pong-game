## Overview
The game is just like the original: [README under construction]

The code is well commented, and only requires Python2 to be installed, however, it does use Tkinter, which should come pre-installed with Python2, but may not be for various reasons. Additional download information is below.

## Download and Play
 1. Make sure you have Python installed. Install Python at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Most computers running macOS should have Python pre-installed. Check if you have Python installed by typing the command ```python``` and pressing enter in your command prompt or terminal. If a prompt like ```>>>``` shows up, then Python is installed.
 2. Run the following command to download and play Python Pong! Note that this will download a file called ```pong.py``` into your current working directory.
 
 ```bash
 curl https://xtrp.github.io/python-pong/pong.py -o pong.py && python pong.py
 ```
